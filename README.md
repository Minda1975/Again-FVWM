# Again-FVWM
This minimal but useful FVWM config, running in the minimal (844 pkgs) Debian 10.3 system. 

As for packages, i use almost only cli programs: `mpv, mpalyer, cdw, mpg123, sox, mc, alsamixer, htop, irssi, xloadimage, patool, w3m` and only these gui programs: `Firefox-esr, Audacious, Alsaplayer, Xpaint, SpaceFM, Gmrun, Transmission-gtk, Xter, Urxvt and Alsamixergui`.

As for FVWM configuratiin, this is minimal configuration, who was shamefully conceived from [bfmartin](https://github.com/bfmartin/fvwm-config-on-openbsd) and adapted for modern FVWM (2.6.8-1) version. I corrected erros in logs, removed deprecated functions etc..

Also, i added custom keybindings, coreccted errors in FVWMButtons module.
